# TIC TAC TOE :x: :trophy: :o: :four_leaf_clover:

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe, a simple but really funny game for two players. I have learned to work with TypeScript in React.

## Features :star:

- the X turn starts the game by default
- the screen shows how the turn changes automatically every time
- there are 3 posibilities: winner X , winner O or tie
- when the game is over, a modal appers to show the final result and a play again button
- in the middle of a game, the user can restart it with a reset button
- the web uses local storage to save the game, so if the page is updated, it renders the lastest state of the game

## Tech Stack 📚
